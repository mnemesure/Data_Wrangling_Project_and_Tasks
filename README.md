# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks

This repository is to keep the work I have done in a data wrangling class at Dartmouth.
I have been given permission to make this work public.

Project 1 was to rename columns and update codes in SQL
Project 2 was to add columns and get some brief overview information from the data in SQL
Project 3 was to compute rates and access data in multiple tables with joins in R using dplyr
The midterm project was to use both R and SQL to set up a data set for easy viewing and possible analysis
The final Project was to pull useful information from multiple tables in R and SQL
